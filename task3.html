    <p>ParagraphParagraphs are the group of 
        sentences combined together, about a certain topic.
         It is a very important form of writing as we write
          almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay,
           story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured
            paragraph is the essence of good writing.
             The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to
              explain something, to tell a story, and to convince 
              someone that our idea is right.
